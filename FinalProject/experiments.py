#  THE GOAL OF THIS CODE:
#  The point of the following code is to test the question: what algorithm will consistently find the solution fastest at each variation of N discs in Towers of Hanoi?
#  To answer this question, there's a few tests that have been created to see which algorithm is the best performing with respect to time. There's 3 experiments that
#  are tested in this code, and they help answer the research question that has been propositioned.

    # EXPERIMENT 1: THE GOAL EXPERIMENT 1 IS MEANT TO TEST EACH OF THE 3 ALGORITHMS, DFS, BFS, AND DLDFS. EACH ALGORITHM WILL SOLVE TOWERS WITH A DISC SIZE OF 3,4 AND 5. THE DEPTH 
    # LIMIT FOR DLDFS WILL ALWAYS BE SET TO THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION DEPTH HERE, WHICH IS 2^N - 1 MOVES. THE IDEA IS THAT THIS TEST WILL DETERMINE WHICH ALGORITHM CAN SOLVE THE TOWERS
    # OF HANOI PROBLEM THE FASTEST.
