##### FILES INCLUDED IN THE "INTO THE DEEP: TIMING ALGORITHMS AND FINDING SPEED" FINAL PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION #####

ALGORITHM.PY -- Setup for counting the number of nodes and the frontier on each problem
EXPERIMENTS.PY -- Experiments 1-3 that were dicussed in the paper put into code to execute
NODE.PY -- Handler for the nodes that exist in the tree for each algorithm
PROBLEM.PY -- Setup class for some problem to be solved (Towers of Hanoi in this case)
SEARCH.PY -- Implementation of all the algorithms (BFS, DFS, and DL_DFS are used for the project)
TOWERS.PY -- Class for the setup of the Towers of Hanoi problem
UTILS.PY -- Class for printing the information like time and nodes searched, as well as keeping a real time update of how many nodes are visited while the code is run

##### NON-IMPORTANT FOLDERS ALSO INCLUDED #####

__PYCACHE__ -- Used for storing information during execution in VS Code
.VS -- Setup for VS Code to run Python
.VSCODE -- Folder for VS Code specific magic that is only used when being run in VS Code
